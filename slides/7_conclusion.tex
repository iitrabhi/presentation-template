  \begin{enumerate} [(I)]
	\item General guidelines for handling medium to large-scale systems in FEniCS
	\begin{enumerate} [(i)]
      \item Always profile the code and look for bottlenecks.
      \item Avoid use of loops in python. Look for efficient alternatives.
      \item Avoid re-evaluation of matrices that do not change.
      \item Evaluate and write only necessary simulation outputs.
      \item In an iterative process evaluate output at every $n^{th}$ step to further speed up the simulation.
	  \item Properly select/configure the solver and preconditioner based on the problem.

	\end{enumerate}
	\item Stepping into the realm of large scale simulations require knowledge of good programming practices, parallelization, and a deep understanding of the working principles of the tools/libraries.
  \end{enumerate}
